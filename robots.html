      <h3>(Nicknamed Mr. Wheelies)</h3>
      <p>
        Mr. Whistles is our rookie-year robot that was designed to compete in the 2024 FRC game CRESCENDO at the 2024 Colorado Regionals.  We started building at the beginning of January and finalized it a week before the regional competition.
      </p>
      <h3>Specifications include:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>6 6inch rev traction wheel Tank Drive</li>
        <li>REV NEO 3-phase power motors</li>
        <li>REV VORTEX 3-phase power motors with integrated SPARK FLEX motor controllers</li>
        <li>6 REV SPARK MAX motor controllers</li>
        <li>Weighs around 70 lbs</li>
        <li>Communications radio</li>
        <li>Climber for end-game point-scoring</li>
        <li>Integrated Roborio circuit</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>How it works:</h3>
      <p>
        On command from the operator, the robot intakes a game piece into the polycarb intake rollers. These rollers then hold the note until the driver has maneuvered the robot to the scoring zone. When ready, the operator revs up the flywheels, and the rollers index the game piece into the flywheels and thrust the piece into the scoring zone.  At the end of the match, the driver extends the climber and drives toward the stage, once contact with the chain and left support pillar is made, the driver retracts the climber lifting the robot off the ground to score final points for their alliance.

      <p>
        Chernobyl is our 2nd robot of 2024 designed to compete in an off-season game FUSION FRENDZY at Cherry Creek HS.  We started the build process late and built the whole bot in about 24 hours.
      </p>
      <h3>Specifications include:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>6 6inch Andymark Hi-Grip wheel Tank Drive</li>
        <li>standard CIM 2-phase power motors</li>
        <li>REV VORTEX 3-phase power motors with integrated SPARK FLEX motor controllers</li>
        <li>4 REV SPARK MAX motor controllers</li>
        <li>Weighs around 70 lbs</li>
        <li>Communications radio</li>
        <li>large polycarb hopper with front mounted flywheels</li>
        <li>Integrated Roborio circuit</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>How it works:</h3>
      <p>
        during the autonomous period, the robot drives forward and scores 10  game pieces. After the autonomous period, the driver will maneuver the robot to the intake zone. the human player will load 10+ game pieces into the hopper and then signal to the driver. the river will then maneuver back to the scoring zone. at the scoring zone, the operator will score the pieces using the flywheels on the hopper.

      <h3>(Nicknamed OwO Cwabs)</h3>
      <p>
        Jaws is our second-year robot designed to compete in the 2025 FRC game REEFSCAPE at the 2025 Colorado Regionals.  We started building at the beginning of January 
      </p>
      <h3>Specifications include:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>6 4inch billet wheel Tank Drive</li>
        <li>REV NEO 3-phase power motors</li>
        <li>REV VORTEX 3-phase power motors with integrated SPARK FLEX motor controllers</li>
        <li>6 REV SPARK MAX motor controllers</li>
        <li>Weighs around 120 lbs</li>
        <li>VH_109 Communications radio</li>
        <li>large arm for game-piece scoring</li>
        <li>Integrated Roborio circuit</li>
        <li>pneumatic control system</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>How it works:</h3>
      <p>
        On command from the operator, the robot takes a game piece into the manipulator on the arm. when the game piece is secure in the manipulator, the driver maneuvers the robot toward the scoring objective. When the robot approaches the goal, the driver will communicate the level (L1-L4) that they want to score, and then with that info, the operator will push the corresponding button on their controller and the arm will automatically move into the scoring position. once the driver moves the robot into position, the operator will release the game piece onto the goal, and reset for another cycle.
