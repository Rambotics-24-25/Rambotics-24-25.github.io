      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>
        We started in 2023 which created an exciting chapter for Rambotics as we embarked on a journey of growth and discovery. From our humble beginnings, we've experienced remarkable progress and development. With each meeting, competition, and outreach event, our team has evolved, both individually and collectively. Through perseverance and teamwork, we've overcome challenges, honed our skills, and expanded our horizons. Our growth isn't just measured by our achievements but also by the bonds we've formed and the lessons we've learned along the way. As we reflect on our journey, we're proud of how far we've come and excited for the opportunities that lie ahead.
